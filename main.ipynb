    "## Project Description\n",
    "LlamaDocIndexer is an innovative tool designed to streamline and enhance the way large volumes of documents are managed and accessed. Built on the robust LlamaIndex framework, this project serves as a vital bridge between extensive language model applications and specific, often private, data repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "The primary purpose of LlamaDocIndexer is to simplify the process of indexing a diverse array of documents stored in various formats, such as PDFs, text files, and slides. By automating the indexing process, this tool aims to make the retrieval of information both efficient and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Automated Indexing: To recursively scan and index documents in a specified folder, enabling a structured and searchable database.\n",
    "2. Change Detection and Updating: To automatically detect changes in the documents and update the index accordingly, ensuring that the most current information is always available.\n",
    "3. Ease of Integration: To provide seamless integration with existing language model applications, enhancing their capability to process and understand domain-specific data.\n",
    "4. User Accessibility: To create an intuitive interface that allows users to easily query and retrieve information from the indexed data.\n",
    "5. Scalability and Flexibility: To ensure that the tool can handle a growing volume of data and adapt to various data formats and structures.\n",
